06.Matrix - I'm using The Greedy algorithm approach,
which is solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment.
we are starting off by selecting the lowest number that we have in the matrix.
as we don't have any negative numbers, the greedy algorithm is the most time optimal choice.
